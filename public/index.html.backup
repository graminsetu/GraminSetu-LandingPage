      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

    <!--
    Only include the Clarity script in production builds.
    In development, this script should be commented out or removed.
    To automate this, use environment variables and inject the script only when NODE_ENV === 'production'.
    Example for Create React App:
    {process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' && (
      <script type="text/javascript">
        (function(c,l,a,r,i,t,y){
          c[a]=c[a]||function(){(c[a].q=c[a].q||[]).push(arguments)};
          t=l.createElement(r);t.async=1;t.src="https://www.clarity.ms/tag/"+i;
          y=l.getElementsByTagName(r)[0];y.parentNode.insertBefore(t,y);
        })(window, document, "clarity", "script", "t2zwxaj8bt");
      </script>
    )}
    For static HTML, manually comment/uncomment the script below as needed:
  -->
    <!-- UNCOMMENT THIS SCRIPT ONLY FOR PRODUCTION. DO NOT USE IN DEVELOPMENT. -->
    <!-- <script type="text/javascript">
    (function(c,l,a,r,i,t,y){
